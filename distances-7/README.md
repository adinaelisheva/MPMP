### Puzzle number 7
#### The Unique Distancing Puzzle

See https://www.think-maths.co.uk/uniquedistance

The question: how can you arrange N tokens on an NxN grid such that no distance between any 2 tokens is duplicated?

The official puzzle was for 6 tokens on a 6x6 grid. I ran this up to 7 for fun. 8 started to take awhile so I didn't bother, but you could try it yourself!

```> node distances.js```

#### Notes

This only finds *A* solution, not *ALL* solutions.
