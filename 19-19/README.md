### Puzzle number 19
#### The 19 Challenge

See https://www.think-maths.co.uk/19challenge

The question: Find a number n (aside from 1 or 19) where the first n primes squared add to a multiple of n.

Ran a quick for loop over the first 100 primes and got only 1, 19, and 37.

Usage: `node 19.js`

Sample output:
```
The first 1 primes, squared, sum to 4, which is 1 * 4
The first 19 primes, squared, sum to 24966, which is 19 * 1314
The first 37 primes, squared, sum to 263736, which is 37 * 7128
```
